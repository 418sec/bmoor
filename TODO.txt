- create a function to register new functions on bMoor

- create a wrapper function that allows you to instantiate and also pass in gets.  So a API becomes : ( path <string>, root <object - default to global> )
	* bMoor.get - return back the object, create it if it isnâ€™t there already
	* bMoor.exist - return back the object if it is found, undefined otherwise
	* bMoor.require - like exist, but sync requires for the class if not found

- Error Handling

- General tests
