	- use a controller pattern that binds to the models to push updates
	- rejecting the idea of allowing a model to push itself
	- have nodes subscribe to controller, and the .data attribute gets binded to
	- create a resource hash
	- function for defining resources and assigning variables
	- allow attributes to map to url variables : should be function of the controller
	
Form Validator
	- form node should become a decorator
	- form validation should also be a decorator

List dynamics improved
	- lists aren't really very dynamic
	- they need to key rows, so a key attribute needs to be passed in
