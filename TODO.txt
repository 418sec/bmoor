Modules
*	- Singletons can define what bMoor.module they publish to
*	- Idea is that all modules have same interface
*	- can be used globally then, for instance 'bMoor.module.Resource', 'bMoor.module.Template', etc
	- modules
*		- template : existing JQote would go here, and default templator would be this
		- resource : Allows for pulling down scripts, styles, POST, GET, etc...  Move code out of bMoor core...
		
Templates
	- for an element that doesn't have a template, its content becomes the template content
	- allow for prepoped content and dynamic content inserted in between in lists
	
Remotely binded models
	- use a controller pattern that binds to the models to push updates
	- rejecting the idea of allowing a model to push itself
	- have nodes subscribe to controller, and the .data attribute gets binded to
	- create a resource hash
	- function for defining resources and assigning variables
	- allow attributes to map to url variables : should be function of the controller
	
Form Validator
	- form node should become a decorator
	- form validation should also be a decorator
