bMoor : A way to tie your site together
==================================================

The purpose of this framework is to allow for an simpler OO construction of base Javascript objects.
The interface is designed to replicate how server side languages structure extending and including objects, allowing for server side programmers to have
a more natural feel when working with Javascript.  All code can be configured to require other classes to be loaded before running.  It also enforces how
the Javascript is organized, so it can be autoloaded.

Examples
--------------------------------------------------
For examples on how the code can be implemented, look through the /tests directory.  These are configured to be run from their existing directory.
